A simple theme for testing Gutenberg.

== Description ==

The Gutenberg Starter theme is designed to provide a simple, interference-free theme for testing Gutenberg. It is built so that its front-end appearance is as close to the editor's default Gutenberg styles as possible. 

The theme is primarily intended for use by those developing for and testing Gutenberg, but may also be helpful for those developing themes, or for folks who would like their site to look like Gutenberg in general. 

This version of the Gutenberg Starter Theme is built as a block-based Theme.

== Installation == 

1. Create a fresh WordPress site
2. Clone this repository or upload a zip into the siteâ€™s themes directory
3. Install the Gutenberg plugin
4. Enable the Full Site Editing experiment in the Gutenberg > Experiments panel.
5. Activate the "Gutenberg Starter Theme Blocks" theme from within Appearance > Themes.
6. Visit the Customizer and hit "Publish".

Compare the resulting site to the Twenty Nineteen Demo site. It should look pretty similar.
